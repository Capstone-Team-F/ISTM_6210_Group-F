Group F's Capstone File Repository 

There are two zip files attached that are needed for our project to properly operate; "capstone1" and "capstonedb.sql".

"capstone1" will contain all the files located within our AWS folder and contains all functioning HTML and PHP files needed to host the project's site. 
Included are multiple labelled topic folders to help indicate where each respective file for the site is located and to help with the organization of the files.

"capstonedb.sql" is our active database file, which will allow you to upload our database and the two database tables with their respective data.
This database file should be imported into a new myphpadmin database and will allow any user to utilize our website's database function's properly.
